# cleaning_data

Repo for submission of Coursera Getting and cleaning data course project.

## Background 

This is a coursera Getting and cleaning data course project. The data used is from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. Find more here http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

Data can be downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. You will need to unzip the data and chance your working directory to where the data is before running the analysis script. 


The run_analysis.R R script does the following :

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The cleaned data in step 5 above is part of this repository.
